# startr.style.core TODO

## 🚧 High Priority

- [ ] **🔥 Resolve the `--br` shorthand collision** — `src/utilities/_border.css` binds `--br` to both `border-radius` (line 6) and `border-right` (line 10). Because `border-right` is a shorthand and its rule lands after `border: var(--b)` in the built sheet, any element using `--b` + `--br` loses its right border (`border-right-style` resets to `none`). Confirmed live on build.sage.education cards; consumer worked around it by swapping to the `--radius` alias (2026-08-26). #bug #critical
  - [ ] Proposed fix (NOT settled — needs team review before shipping): drop the `border-right, --br` binding; keep `--br` = border-radius since every known consumer and doc uses it that way; give border-right a new name (`--b-rt`? `--bri`? mirror across `--bt/--bl/--bb` for a consistent side set?). Renaming is a breaking change for any consumer that used `--br` as border-right — audit first.
  - [ ] Same review should rule on the sibling dual bindings: `--bs` (border-style vs box-shadow), `--td` (text-decoration vs transition-delay), `--fs` (font-style vs flex-shrink), `--cr` (column-rule vs clear). Value-disjoint today, so they work by luck; each is one valid-in-both value away from a silent failure (`--bs:none` already collides).
  - [ ] After the naming call: rebuild and redeploy `startr.style/style.css` — the live sheet carries the collision (border-radius line 823, border-right line 839).
  - [ ] Decide whether `WEB-Startr.Style/src/static/style.css` should be regenerated from core instead of hand-maintained. Evidence the two forked: `--fs` definition order is flipped between repos, and core has no print (`-pt`) tier while main carries ~120 `-pt` props.
